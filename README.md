# Mohamed Rafiudeen - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hello, I'm Mohamed Rafiudeen! I graduated in Civil Engineering and am currently transitioning into the field of Data Science and Analytics. I have developed a strong foundation in data analysis and problem-solving, driven by my passion for data-driven decision-making. I am excited to bring my analytical skills and technical expertise to the field as an entry-level data analyst.

Throughout my journey, I have honed my skills in tools like Excel, Power BI, SQL, Alteryx, Python libraries for Data Analysis and Visualizations, gaining certifications that showcase my commitment to continuous learning and I believe i can be a valuable asset in my role as a Data Analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques and am always eager to expand my knowledge. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I am driven by the satisfaction of uncovering insights and using data to solve real-world challenges.

## Portfolio Projects

### Road Accident Analysis
**Dashboard:** [`Road_Accident_Analysis.pdf`](https://github.com/mdrafi-m/PowerBI_Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Road_Accident_Analysis.pdf)

**Dataset:** [`Road Accident Data.xlsx`](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uyiJU34fq9IKEu5b3VQYIhTg8g4ay0pA/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113517447462220988150&rtpof=true&sd=true)

**PowerBI File:** [`Road_Accident_Analysis.pbix`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ckfbxJVNrWqEUh673Ys06abnkrHTT9QE/view?usp=sharing)

**Description:** The dataset contains 30000+ rows of detailed road accident information with 21 columns, covering key aspects such as accident date, time, and location (latitude and district). It includes factors like accident severity, road and weather conditions, lighting, and junction control, providing context for each incident. Additionally, it records the number of vehicles and casualties involved, along with vehicle types and the police force handling the case. This data is valuable for identifying patterns, risk factors, and improving road safety measures.Due to the large size of the dataset, the Power BI file exceeds the upload limit. As a solution, I have uploaded both files to Google Drive and provided the links for reference
